# Spacecraft-Trajectory-Design-using-Space-Manifold-Dynamics
Low Energy trajectories that mostly utilises natural dynamics are now used to design successful and efficient missions. A single spacecraft is designed to orbit moons of Jupiter, Ganymede and Europa. The mission utilizes dynamical channels in the phase space which connects the vicinity of Ganymede to that of Europa. The system is highly nonlinear and dependent on initial condition. Dynamic equations are obtained and a controller based on the dynamic inverse is synthesized for the purpose of stabilization and trajectory tracking
